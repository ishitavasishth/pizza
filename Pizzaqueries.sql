-- Which of the 19 stores in the dataset has the lowest average (unweighted) price for Tombstone? (report the store number using the store id from the dataset)
select store, avg(price) as avg_price
from pizza
group by store
order by avg_price
limit 1;
-- #Store 4956 has the lowest avg price of 3.5265

-- Count the number of times that there was a Tombstone feature but not a Tombstone display? (report as an integer)

select *

-- What is the most frequently occurring (modal) price in the dataset? (report the modal price rounded to two decimal places, dollar sign not needed)
select price, round(count(price),2) as price_count
from pizza
group by price
order by price_count desc
limit 1;
-- 4.99 gets repeated 34 times and is the modal price


-- Using the category volume variable as the denominator, and the sum total of the data for all the weeks and all the stores, compute and report the unit volume-based market share for Tombstone. (report the market share rounded to three decimal places)
select sum(unit_sales)/sum(category_volume) as market_share

--0.268 is the market share

-- Across all the stores and all the weeks where the conditions are met, what is the mean difference between the unweighted average unit sales when there is a Tombstone display, compared to the unweighted average unit sales where there is not a Tombstone display?
